    <p>Ode to Andrew Gough, Lover of Bacon and Eggs

In the realm of mornings bright and clear,
Where sunlight dances without a fear,
There's a friend named Andrew, hearty and bold,
Whose love for bacon and eggs, I'm told.

With each dawn's first light, he takes his stand,
Sizzling bacon in a seasoned pan,
Golden yolks like suns that rise,
On his plate, a breakfast paradise.

Oh Andrew Gough, with appetite grand,
Your breakfast ritual, a legend so grand,
Bacon crisp and eggs so divine,
In your world, morning joys align.

Through crispy days and sunny side highs,
Your love for these treats never dies,
A friend so true to morning's call,
With bacon and eggs, you conquer all.

Here's to Andrew Gough, whose hearty cheer,
Brings bacon's sizzle and eggs so dear,
May your mornings forever be bright,
With bacon and eggs, your heart's delight.

I hope this poem captures Andrew's zest for breakfast delights and brings a smile to both of your faces!.</p>
